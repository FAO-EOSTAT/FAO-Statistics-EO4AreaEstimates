EO4AreaEstimates

EO4AreaEstimates provides a reproducible statistical workflow for producing crop area estimates from satellite-derived crop classification maps in a manner consistent with official agricultural statistics.

Earth Observation (EO) products such as crop type maps are increasingly available at national and regional scale. However, classification outputs alone cannot be directly used as official statistics because they may contain systematic bias and their accuracy varies across space, crops and agro-ecological zones. National Statistical Offices require transparent methodologies that provide unbiased estimates and quantified uncertainty.

This repository implements a workflow that bridges remote sensing and statistical production by integrating:

- EO crop classification maps
- probability sampling design
- reference (ground) observations
- bias correction procedures
- design-based area estimation
- confidence interval and uncertainty estimation

The workflow allows countries to transform EO-derived information into statistically valid crop area estimates that can support agricultural statistics, food security monitoring, and policy decision-making.

The methodology follows internationally recognized principles for agricultural statistics and supports the operational use of EO within national statistical systems.
