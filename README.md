This repository is maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) under the EOSTAT – Earth Observation for Statistics initiative.

The repository will host a reproducible statistical workflow for producing crop area estimates from Earth Observation (EO) data using sampling-based estimation and uncertainty quantification methods consistent with official agricultural statistics.

Earth Observation products such as crop classification maps are increasingly available; however, classification outputs alone cannot be directly used as official statistics. National Statistical Offices require transparent methodologies that provide unbiased estimates and documented uncertainty. This repository supports the operational integration of EO into national agricultural statistics systems by providing a standardized statistical estimation workflow.

The methodology bridges remote sensing and statistical production by integrating:

-EO-derived crop classification layers
-probability sampling design
-reference (ground) observations
-bias correction procedures
-design-based area estimation
-confidence interval and uncertainty estimation

The repository is currently being prepared for institutional transfer of the methodology developed under FAO technical activities. Full content and documentation will be available following completion of the repository transfer process.

Institutional Context

This work is part of FAO’s efforts to support countries in adopting Earth Observation for agricultural statistics production and SDG monitoring. The repository will be maintained by FAO as a public methodological resource to facilitate transparent, reproducible and nationally owned data production systems.

Intended Users

The repository is intended for:

- National Statistical Offices
- Ministries of Agriculture
- Agricultural statistics units
- Geospatial and remote sensing analysts supporting official statistics

FAO technical assistance programmes and partnerslogy follows internationally recognized principles for agricultural statistics and supports the operational use of EO within national statistical systems.
